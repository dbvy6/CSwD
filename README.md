# CSwD
## Plans
### Master git, specifically learn the command line. Learn how branches work and how to utilize them efficiently, like a development/testing/developing pipeline.
### Create a fullstack project similar to geeks for geeks, more blog style, where I talk about what I'm  learning and making.
